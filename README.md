# de.NBI Heat orchestration templates

This repository contains various templates developed by de.NBI members for the de.NBI cloud.

## Repository organisation

Each template (or set of related templated) should be put into a subdirectory of its own. A README file should describe the template, whether it needs to be adopted for cloud istes (e.g. URLs or default values), and how the template should be used.
